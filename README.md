# README

RuBB, a very minimal Rails-based forum for friends

Currently a work-in-progress that aims to be like [pgBoard](https://github.com/pgBoard/pgBoard) but in active development, and with even less features.

Deeply influenced by [Darius Kazemi's run your own social](https://runyourown.social/) and participating in the community that he describes, and many years spent on the internet. More on this and the aims of this project TK

## Contributing

I welcome contributions, but have pretty specific goals for this project so discourage submitting features without us discussing them first. I do keep sketches of things I'm considering and intend to tackle [in the issues](https://github.com/hartsick/ruBB/issues), and casually keep a running prioritized backlog [in this project](https://github.com/hartsick/ruBB/projects/2).

If you have an idea or one of the existing issues looks interesting to you (as bare as it may be), shoot me an email so we can talk! Or feel free to comment on an issue, if you'd prefer. I'd like to have a small set of interested developers that have same goals in mind rather than cultivating a wider set of contributors, so think that talking about those goals and ideas before someone contributes would be helpful.
